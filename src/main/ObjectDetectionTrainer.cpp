    This example program shows how you can use dlib to make an object detector
    for things like faces, pedestrians, and any other semi-rigid object.  In
    particular, we go though the steps to train the kind of sliding window
    object detector first published by Dalal and Triggs in 2005 in the paper
    Histograms of Oriented Gradients for Human Detection.

    Note that this program executes fastest when compiled with at least SSE2
    instructions enabled.  So if you are using a PC with an Intel or AMD chip
    then you should enable at least SSE2 instructions.  If you are using cmake
    to compile this program you can enable them by using one of the following
    commands when you create the build project:
        cmake path_to_dlib_root/examples -DUSE_SSE2_INSTRUCTIONS=ON
        cmake path_to_dlib_root/examples -DUSE_SSE4_INSTRUCTIONS=ON
        cmake path_to_dlib_root/examples -DUSE_AVX_INSTRUCTIONS=ON
    This will set the appropriate compiler options for GCC, clang, Visual
    Studio, or the Intel compiler.  If you are using another compiler then you
    need to consult your compiler's manual to determine how to enable these
    instructions.  Note that AVX is the fastest but requires a CPU from at least
    2011.  SSE4 is the next fastest and is supported by most current machines.

        // Once you have trained an object detector it is always important to
        // test it on data it wasn't trained on.  Therefore, we will also load
        // a separate testing set of 5 images.  Once we have a face detector
        // created from the training data we will see how well it works by
        // running it on the testing images.
        //
        // So here we create the variables that will hold our dataset.
        // images_train will hold the 4 training images and face_boxes_train
        // holds the locations of the faces in the training images.  So for
        // example, the image images_train[0] has the faces given by the

        // the data into images_train and face_boxes_train.  But for convenience

        // files.  Here you see how to load the data.  To create the XML files
        // you can use the imglab tool which can be found in the tools/imglab
        // folder.  It is a simple graphical tool for labeling objects in images

        // because it will allow us to detect smaller faces than otherwise would
        // be practical (since the faces are all now twice as big).  Note that,
        // in addition to resizing the images, these functions also make the
        // appropriate adjustments to the face boxes so that they still fall on
        // top of the faces after the images are resized.

        // into images_train.  So this next step doubles the size of our

        // Gradients (commonly called HOG) detector.  The 6 means that you want
        // it to use an image pyramid that downsamples the image at a ratio of
        // 5/6.  Recall that HOG detectors work by creating an image pyramid and
        // then running the detector over each pyramid level in a sliding window

        // empirically by checking how well the trained detector works on a test set of

        // a face.

        // show the output of the face detector overlaid on each image.  You will see that
        // it finds all the faces without false alarming on any non-faces.
